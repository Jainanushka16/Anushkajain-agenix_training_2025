## Overview

The Library Management System is a database-driven system designed to manage and organize library operations effectively. It helps in streamlining the processes of managing books, authors, staff, and customer transactions. This repository contains the **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**, database structure, and documentation that illustrates the logical design of the system.



 Key Features

- Efficient management of library books, including genres, authors, and publishing information.
- Customer and staff management with roles and responsibilities clearly defined.
- Real-time tracking of book transactions such as issue and return.
- Support for membership and fine tracking.
- Scalable design for future enhancements.
